## Project Description

Replace this text with your project description and list the key features below  

This website will be used by two different end-users. The first set of end users are Admins/ Parents. The Admins will be able to add and/or delete tasks from the system. They will also be able to see which user has completed a task and as a result, reward said user with the amount of set time on their devices/phones. The other set of users will be the task workers/ children. These users cannot directly edit the tasks; they can only view the set tasks by the admins and tick it off after the task has been completed.  

The key features of this website:

- Two different sets of users (Admins and Task-Users).
- The addition and removal of tasks from the user's view but kept in the database.
- Having a Boolean that checks to see if the task is still available.
- At the end of each day, the tasks reset and the admins have to add new ones the next day.
- Tasks can be added to the system
- Tasks can be marked as done

## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 3**, assessed against standards [91902](docs/as91902.pdf) and [91903](docs/as91903.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database. The final deployment of the app is on [Render](https://render.com/), with the database hosted at [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **complex database techniques**:
- Structuring the data using multiple tables
- Creating queries which insert, update or delete to modify data
- Creating customised data displays from multiple tables (e.g. web pages)
- Dynamically linking data between the database and a front-end display
- Applying data access permissions as appropriate to the outcome

The project demonstrates a number of **complex digital media (web) techniques**:
- Using non-core functionality
- Using sophisticated digital effects
- Applying industry standards or guidelines
- Using responsive design for use on multiple devices
- The integration of original media assets
- Using dynamic data handling and interactivity
- Automation through scripts
