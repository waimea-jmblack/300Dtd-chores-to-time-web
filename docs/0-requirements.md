# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

The problem that the end users require me to solve is that their children are spending too much time on their devices and not finishing the chores/ work around the house. I will attempt to solve this problem by creating a website where parents can put tasks into a list that the children can complete in return for a certain amount of time on their devices. 



## End-User Requirements

There are two different types of end users in this topic, The Admins/ Parents and the Workers/ Children. The Admins need a system in which they can sign in + out, easily edit the task sheet (Ie., Things like addition and deletion of tasks, etc.) and to also be able to access and see all the tasks completed or not completed in the database, as it resets every day. The Workers need to be able to look at the sign in + out, task description and complete tasks. 

## Proposed Solution

I intend to create a system that allows users to either be able to add and delete tasks (whilst being stored in the database), or to be able to complete tasks for certain amounts of time on cellular devices e.g., Unload Dishwasher = 20 minutes on a device. The key functionality of this website is that the admins/ parents can add tasks to the network for the kids to complete.

# Relevant Implications

---

## Privacy Implication

This implication is refferring to how the digital technology or digital outcome (i.e., The Website), protects end users data from foriegn threats to the system and the users data.


### Relevance to the System

This is relevant to the system/ website due to its significant importance. This is because without end to end data encryption, any data about not only the uses]rs, but the website as a whole can be easily accesiable to any threat, who would want to steal that data for their own gain. This data would need to have a high security


### Impact / Considerations

This website will be used by two different end-users. The first set of end users are Admins/ Parents. The Admins will be able to add and/or delete tasks from the system. They will also be able to see which user has completed a task and as a result, reward said user with the amount of set time on their devices/phones. The other set of users will be the task workers/ children. These users cannot directly edit the tasks; they can only view the set tasks by the admins and tick it off after the task has been completed.  

The key features of this website: Two different sets of users (Admins and Task-Users). The addition and removal of tasks from the user's view but kept in the database. Having a Boolean that checks to see if the task is still available, etc. 



## Usability Implication

The Usability Implication of Digital Technologies refers to how easily an end user can access and use the website without any help or guidance. This means that for this Implication to be not only functional but also active and of use, it needs to be a top priority heuristic 


### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant to this particular project due to the significant importance of it. Without the Useability Implication acting as the foundation of the website, the rest of the implications and the site as a whole would not run, let alone work to the standards of the end users. 


### Impact / Considerations

This means that we need to ensure that the end users can easily access, control and use the website that we are creating. This will have to work for both different types of end users (Parents and Children). It is vital that we build the website in a way that makes every action obvious and easy to use, as the age range for end users could range anywhere from 5 to 80+. 

Note to self: You know what you need to do.
