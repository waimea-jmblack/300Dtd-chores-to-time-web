## Project Description

Replace this text with your project description and list the key features below  

This website will be used by two different end-users. The first set of end users are Admins/ Parents. The Admins will be able to add and/or delete tasks from the system. They will also be able to see which user has completed a task and as a result, reward said user with the amount of set time on their devices/phones. The other set of users will be the task workers/ children. These users cannot directly edit the tasks; they can only view the set tasks by the admins and tick it off after the task has been completed.  

The key features of this website:

- Two different sets of users (Admins and Task-Users).
- The addition and removal of tasks from the user's view but kept in the database.
- Having a Boolean that checks to see if the task is still available.
- At the end of each day, the tasks reset and the admins have to add new ones the next day.
- Feature 5 here
